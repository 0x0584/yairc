* Yet Another Internet Relay Chat

* Networking API

All networking API function are considered equivalent to system calls such as =read= or =write=, they lay in man(2).

** Creating =socket()= and =struct sockaddr=

When =socket()= is created, which is just allocating a file resource in the OS, by specifiying the protocol family and type, and which mode of transmission i.e. UDP or TCP. It requires additional information on the address itself, namelty the host and the port, which both should be in machine encoding i.e. same behaviour as =hton()=.

 - Except that =inet_addr()= returns the address in machine encoding already

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  As a legacy, there are two types =struct sockaddr= and =struct sockaddr_in=, they represent the same information, but the later is more convenient to work with.
#+END_QUOTE

At last, both the socket and the address are entangeled using =bind()=
